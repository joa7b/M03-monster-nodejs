        "Johan Liebert is the titular 'monster' and main antagonist of the series. On the surface, Johan is a well-mannered, charismatic, and compassionate yet somewhat aloof young man. He possesses a myriad of favorable traits and can easily overwhelm individuals with his seemingly flawless nature. This meticulously crafted facade makes it easy for him to make new allies and manipulate them into doing various deeds for him through the influence of his supposed friendship and good will. With such skill in creating this sense of perfection and pureness, Johan hides his true motives with ease. Many of Johan's beliefs run consistent with nihilism, as he does not see any meaning to life. He claims, 'Most of this universe is 'death' anyway,' and that to the universe, 'most lives are just specks in a corner of the earth, gone in a flash'. #CompleteMonster"
